        <div class="text-block">
            <p>Hello! I'm Ignacio Fianza, born in 2007 and currently residing in the beautiful country of Uruguay. Ever
                since I can remember, I've been passionate about technology and the endless possibilities it offers. My
                journey into the world of computing started early, fueled by constant curiosity and a desire to create
                and innovate.</p>
            <br />
            <p>My English proficiency is certified at A1, and I am actively working to improve my language skills while
                continuing with my studies and projects.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I am currently a student at UTU (Universidad del Trabajo del Uruguay) in the Informatics program. UTU,
                known for its focus on technical and vocational education, has provided me with a solid foundation in
                computer science principles and practical skills. Through this program, I've gained a deep understanding
                of various aspects of computing, from software development to systems administration.</p>
            <br />
            <p>To further enhance my skills and knowledge, I am also enrolled in a Full-Stack Development course at
                DevSchool Academy (Argentina). This intensive program has allowed me to dive deeper into web
                development, mastering both front-end and back-end technologies. From creating dynamic and efficient web
                applications to optimizing performance and designing innovative user interactions, this course has been
                instrumental in shaping my abilities as a developer.</p>
            <br />
            <p>In addition to my passion for technology, I have a strong interest in motorsport and simracing. I follow
                various forms of racing, including Formula 1, Touring Car Racing, Turismo Carretera, the World Endurance
                Championship, IMSA, and Formula Drift. Simracing, in particular, allows me to experience the thrill of
                racing from the comfort of my home, combining my love for cars with my interest in simulation and
                competition.</p>
